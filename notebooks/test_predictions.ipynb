BCS 1.5/5. Owner reports eating normally (not particularly ravenous), not lethargic or overactive, drinking normally and going to the toilet normally. Owner reports last Tuesday she did strain to try and urinate without producing any urine but has been fine since. On palpation of abdomen large irregular mass (5cm x 3cm x 6cm) in mid to caudal abdomen. Feels likely intestinal but difficult to disntinguish, kidneys both palpable and normal size, bladder not palpable but urinated in cat carrier. Advised possibility of mass being from bladder but I can manipulate mass too far cranial for this and would expect more urinary signs. Advised mass is likely to be reason for weight loss as the neoplasia consume lots of energy. Advised different options: 1. do nothing and monitor. 2. SWP bloods to check thyroid and kidneys. 3. Ultrasound scan to determine mass location and give idea of surgical resection +/- x-lap to surgically remove. Advised can use laparoscopic camera to look in abdomen if requested. Funds appear to be issue for now, so bloods taken to check thyroid. Bloods show thyroid is low (could be euthyroid sick) but given other clinical parameters I think this is unlikel (although I did think I could feel a small goitre on right side of layrnx - could be parathyroid and possible high iCa (non ionised Ca is high end of normal). Cholesterol is slightly high: 7.6 (0.9-6.5) this could be incidental finding. Offered to admit and do ultrasound later but advised cost ~£160 and owner not too keen. Advised if surgery conducted and mass removed then ~£1000-1500 not including medication. Advised if not thyroid problem then could look to trial steroid therapy but this is unlikely to make any difference without knowing what the mass is. Will ring owner with results later. STOOP. Relayed results to owner and explained that very unlikely hyperT4 so abdominal mass is likely to be cause for weight. Advised we can investigate further at anytime with imaging +/- surgery. <<identifier>>'s welfare is good at present so advised I am happy just to monitor and we can keep an eye on the mass at regular checkups. I have, however, informed O that <<identifier>> could go down hill very rapidly as we don't know what the mass is and what body systems it is affecting.

Ears bilaterally fairly clean, minimal wax, difficult to advance scope to properly see tm as canals so small and narrow and very anxious/trembling when restrained, cotton bud only normal wax present.

Hopefully positive sign owner says perked up more in here, but also may be due to adrenalin. Similarly, temperature slightly high today but extremely stressed and shaking so difficult to determine how much of an effect this will be having. Other potential differential diagnosis hepatic encephalopathy, etc, could run bloods to check liver, kidney, etc. However absolutely fine and looking well for age before episode and would perhaps expect other signs, weight stable. Hence alternatively could consider neuro referral or treat as suspected vestibular today, in which case anti-nausea injection, rest, food and water little and often in safe, comfortable environment, warned can take up to 72hrs to resolve but contact OOH or ourselves if any deterioration.
